Scrum PM v. 0.1.5

Scrum PM is a plugin for Redmine for Scrum project management. Redmine Version class becomes a sprint and issue becomes task. Most actions support drag and drop, eg. dashboard where you can change status of your task simply by draging it to another column.

# One click documentation generation (rdoc and javadoc)
# Continous integration with cruisecontrol
# Velocity planing
